    I come to programming through what most would consider unconventional means.
    <br>
    <br>
    I graduated from Rutgers University with degrees in English and Theater but soon found myself working in the educational technology industry. For over 3 years at Macmillan Learning, I helped to sell products for the higher education market, to schools from MIT to local community colleges. I managed a territory of schools in Pennsylvania, Texas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, West Virginia, Maine, Idaho, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, traveled to those states, and made sales totaling over 3 million dollars. It's quite amazing that, through software like Launchpad, Writer's Help, Sapling, and FlipIt, students are doing things they have never been able to before. In learning more about the higher education industry and the expertise required to create our technologies, I knew I wanted to be a part of that process.
    <br>
    <br>
    And here I now am.
    <br>
    <br>
    This desire took me back to Rutgers, and through their coding certificate program, I've learned the skills needed to be a full-stack developer. What I can bring to the coding community is an ability to communicate ideas for applications, and a knack for customer satisfaction, along with the hard skills to do the tough work. Should you have any doubts about my being able to talk freely, look no further than my last name.

    Thank you,
