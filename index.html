      <h1>About Me</h1>

		<img class="me" src="assets/images/20170722_183532.jpg" alt= "Picture of Johnny Dellaluna"; width="240" height="240">
		<p>Welcome to my first website! I hope you enjoy it (and take a look at the "Inspect" tool in Chrome, so you can tell me about any updates I need to make). I'm new to coding but certainly not new to why the internet rocks, and I hope this site is the mark of a great beginning to a terrific programming career.
		<br>
		<br>
		I love movies, cartoons, and classic literature. In fact, I can't imagine life without them. I also can't imagine where I'd be without my family and my wonderful girlfriend, Becca. Currently, my work lies in publishing, where I facilitate teaching and learning through higher education sales. Sure, students just rent textbooks now, but it's a living.
		<br>
		<br>
		What I hope to seek from a future career in programming is a chance to develop websites and apps that will change the world. I love video games and would naturally be enamored to help develop a game of my own someday. My journey is an unorthodox path to coding, but despite that, computers make anything possible, and it's my mission to prove that.
