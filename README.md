# Basic-Portfolio

This site will introduce you to myself and the work that I do, and what it means to be a developer in today's economy and societal state. It is built using Bootstrap and the latest HTML5 and CSS3 frameworks. It will be updated continuously with projects, apps, and whatever else can fit!
